Hello :=),

This is a ongoing side-project I have to implement lambda set queries in C++ 11. I really like how C#.NET uses lambda expressions 
with IEnumerable<> objects and set query functions. I thought, wow, what if I could do this in C++?!! C++ 11 has a good lambda expression
feature so I decided to give it a try :=) I am using a std::vector in place of IEnumerable<T> because it is an already well tested and
well supported data structure.
